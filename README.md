# jQuery Salary Calculator 

A test on the grasp of jQuery, Where I worked on calculating employees salary and bonuses. 

## Installations
- Run npm install for dependencies
- Run npm run start
- Navigate to localhost:3000

- Create database and table
1. If you would like to name your database something else, you will need to change untitled_table to the name of your new database name in server/modules/pool.js
2. The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. Use your client of choice to run the queries.

## Additional Information
Worked on this project with two of my classmate Nick Bares and Hunter Webster, during the EmEmerging Digital Academy Boot-camp.
